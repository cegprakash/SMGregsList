Greg's List for Striker Manager
===============================

This application is intended to provide a mechanism for a transfer market
for Striker Manager <http://en3.strikermanager.com>.  It is a PHP-based
application that uses an SQlite3 database to store its information.  The
application stores information on players that are for sale, and allows
simple searching for any attribute of that player.

In addition, it will allow storing saved searches and immediate emailing
when a new player is placed for sale that matches the search parameters.

When the application is ready, a Google chrome extension will be written
that allows accessing the market directly from within Striker Manager.
